         "question":"What is React.js? How does it differ from other Frontend frameworks?",
         "answer":"React.js is a open-source-js library used to build user interfaces(UI) for web applications. It is developed by Jordan Walke (Facebook) and maintained by community of developers . one of the mai  difference between React.js and other frameworks is it's approach to rendering it uses Virtual Dom instead of directly manipulating the browsers Dom . React.js can update the ui more efficiently by only updating trhe parts of the page that have changed ,rather than updating the entire page .React.js focus on buildingreusable components React components are independent ,reusable pieces of code that can be combined to create complex UI's. this enables developers to write less code and makes it easier .overall React.js is a powerfull tool for building dynamic ,responsive and scalable user interfaces for web applications .It is based on declerative programming ,Which means that you describe what you want the UI look like and react.js handles the updates and rendering . It can be used to build single page applications (SPA's) which are web applications that load a single HTML page and dynamically update the content as the user interacts with the application . React.js is used by many popular websites and applications including Facebook,Instagram,NetFlix,Airbnb.It has large active comunity of developers who contribute to the library."

        "question":"Can youn explain concept of the Virtual DOM in React.js?",
        "answer":"In traditional web applications ,The browser's DOM is used to represent the structure of the web page .The DOM is a tree like structure of HTML elements, and each time the state of an application changes ,the browser has to update the DOM to reflest those changes .This process is called reconcillation and it canbe slow and resource-intensive, especially for complex user interfaces .React.js addresses this issue by using a virtual DOM ,The virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM ,created and maintained by React.js whenever the state of a react component changes ,React.js compares the updated virtual DOM to the previous version to identify the specific changes that need to be made to actual DOM rather than updating the entire DOM it only updates the changes results in faster rendering times and a smoother user experience Real DOM------Lightweight copy of virtual DOM (Update)----->update real DOM with those changes .

        "answer":"React components are independent , reusable pieces of code that define part of a user interface in ract application it canbe simple such as a button or a form field or complex ,such as a chart or a data grid .By composing these components together you can create more complex UI's  .React Components are divided into two types 1. Functional Component 2. Class Component . Functional Component: are just JavaScript functions that take in props and return jsx. functional component dont have state,but they can use useState hook to achieve similar functionality. functional components don't have lifecycle methods but they can use useEffect hook to achieve similar functionality. functional components are more resuable as they are just functions which can be easily reused across multiple components. functional components are usually faster and more efficient than class components.It can not use this keyword. it use return to render jsx. Class Component: Class Components are classes that extend the React Component Class and have a render method.class components have state, which is used to store data that can be change over time.class components havelifecycle methods which are methods that get called at diffirent points in the component's lifecycle . the class components are less reusable due to the complex inheritance hierchy and render methods. it uses this keyword to refer their own instance. use render method to render jsx. When it comes to state management In class component state is initialized in the constructor but In functional component state is initialized using the useState hook    ",

        "answer":"Props: is a way to pass data from parent component to child component. some of the best practices are 1.Always pass data down the component tree, from parent to child .this ensures that the data flow is unidirectional and makes it easier to reason about your application state 2.Avoid modifying props directly. props should be considerd read-only and any changes to props should be made in the parent component and passed down again. 3. Use default props to provide fallback values ,you can define default values for props using the default props property on your component. 4.Be careful when passing complex objects or functions as props. It's generally better to keep your props simple and avoid passing complex data structures or functions if possible.",

        "answer":"prop drilling is a concept in React.js where date is passed down from a parent component to a child component,and then passed down to another child component ,and so on. untill it reaches the component it needed. This can lead to a situation where components that don't actually need the data are receiving it as a prop , which can be inefficient and lead to complex and hard to maintain code. To avoid prop drilling one approach is to use the CONTEXT API in React : It allows you to pass data down to components without having to pass it explicitely as props at each level of the component tree.",
